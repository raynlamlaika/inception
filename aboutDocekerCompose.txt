Key components and what they define:
version:
        Specifies the Docker Compose file format version being used. This determines which features and syntax are available.
services:
        This section defines each individual container that makes up your application. For each service, you can specify:
image: The Docker image to use (e.g., nginx:latest, mysql:8.0).

build: Instructions for building a Docker image from a Dockerfile (e.g., context: ., 

dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev).

ports: Port mappings between the host machine and the container (e.g., "8080:80").

environment: Environment variables to set within the container.

volumes: Mount points for persistent data or sharing files between the host and container.

networks: The networks the service should connect to.

depends_on: Specifies service dependencies, ensuring services start in the correct order.

networks:
        Defines custom networks for services to communicate over, providing isolation and control over inter-service communication.
volumes:
        Declares named volumes for persistent data storage that can be shared and reused across services.
